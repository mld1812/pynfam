# Explanations of columns
# label: label of nuclei, for human reading only. 
# category: type of observable, can be "GT", "HL" or "GAP". 
# Z: proton number
# N: neutron number
# A: Z+N, for human reading only. 
# exp: experimental values (true values). 
# energy_min and energy_max: search region for the GT resonance. Leave blank for other categories. Please feel free to tune them. 
# half_width: imaginary part of \omega. Please feel free to tune this. 
# de_hw_ratio: de/half_width, ratio between de and half_width. de is the grid spacing inside the search region. 
# de_hw_ratio: (continue) For GT only. Leave blank for other categories. 
# de_hw_ratio: (continue) For GT if it's left blank, the default value in "pynfam_fit_default.py" will be used. 
# de_hw_ratio: (continue) Recommended value is <~ 1.0. 
# deformation: deformation scan region. Default value (-2,(-0.2,0.0,0.2)) will be used if left blank. 
# deformation (continue): It can be a string with S (spherical), P (prolate) and O (oblate). 
# deformation (continue): It can also be a tuple with the form of (-2,(-0.2,0.0,0.2)). 
# deformation (continue): If only "S" is given, only operator GT_K0 will be calculated for GT. 
# op: operators to use. For HL only. Leave blank for other categories. 
# op (continue): It can be 'ALL','ALLOWED','FORBIDDEN','0+','GAMOWTELLER','1+','0-','1-','2-'. 
# op (continue): For HL if it's left blank, the default value is "ALL". 
# op (continue): If only "ALLOWED" transitions contribute to the beta decay rate, we can set op as "ALLOWED" to reduce computations.
# sigma: normalization factor for the residual.
